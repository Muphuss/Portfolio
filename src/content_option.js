So I Decided to Start learning to play the Keys, then I felt like when i'm playing the keys there are missing some more elements, so I decided to get my first DAW (Magix studio). it didn't took long till I realised I need to switch, so i got my first Fl studio( Flstudio 12) and since there I'm producing music with fl Studio.",
